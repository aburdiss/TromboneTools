Don’t assume you have to “bear down” with your embouchure because this will make you tired quickly.")

The more you want to make progress and the more important your playing is to you, the more you will practice. Try keeping a record of your practice times from day-to-day and strive for a sustained effort over time – every day – without missing any days.")
