If two adjoining notes are in different partials in a slurred passage, it is not necessary to tongue the second note because the partial break removes the smear.")

Vining saves us many steps by organizing tried and true material, adding his own astute innovations and explaining the procedures that produce technical mastery.”", "— Mike Hall, International Trombone Association Journal")
