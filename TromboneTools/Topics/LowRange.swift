                    NumberedBulletPoint(number: "2", text: "When you descend into the low register your embouchure changes shape; your jaw should drop and your chin might move forward or even to the side a little. Every trombonist is unique in what should happen with regard to this change to accommodate the low register. As you descend and your embouchure changes shape, the instrument must be freely responsive to the changing shape of your embouchure. In other words, allow your trombone to move as a reaction to the needs of your embouchure – not the other way around.")
                    Paragraph("These are the two most common problems I see with students: sometimes a student will confuse blowing fast air with blowing lots of slow-moving air and overblow the note; sometimes a student will hold the instrument too rigidly, not allowing its angle to be freely responsive to the inevitable changing shape of the embouchure.")
                    Paragraph("I am not opposed to changing the embouchure for various registers so long as the change can be made while playing. If you are compelled to remove the mouthpiece for every shift in order to get into the low range then you have some more work to do. Practice connected scales and arpeggios until you can move into the low range smoothly.")

For the low range, Rangesongs offers forty songs to extend the range downward in the same fashion to a pedal B-flat.")
