                    Paragraph("There is no question that sight reading is a valuable skill for musicians. Many auditions require sight reading and it is a critical technique for a freelancer. Musicians who sight read well tend to think on their feet better than those who don’t, and this attribute improves their ability to perform under pressure. Good sight readers have a musical intuition and heightened perception that allows them to understand complicated rhythms, harmonies, and musical forms. Sight reading is essentially the confluence of countless diverse musical skills.")
                    Paragraph("If sight reading is so important, why don’t more people take practicing it more seriously? Part of the problem is a lack of guidance. There are few resources devoted entirely to sight reading and even fewer stated strategies for improvement. Here is a list of suggestions for improving your sight reading followed by details about each point:")

This is a difficult technique for most musicians because we spend our practice time stopping and starting in order to fix mistakes, but this approach does not work when sight reading. This book offers a solution to this problem by making players sight read with a partner. Playing duets incentivizes continuing to play no matter what because you don’t want to let down your partner. There is a collective obligation to play the music through to the end so it makes sense.")

In fact, the best sight readers play rhythms correctly even if they don’t always play every pitch correctly. This is particularly important when sight reading in an ensemble situation because it is impossible to stay together if the rhythms are not right.")
                    Paragraph("To improve one’s rhythmic acuity can be challenging because often there are too many other musical obligations to effectively isolate rhythmic deficiencies and fix them. In this book, preliminary “Rhythm Duets” are provided in order to cultivate rhythmic confidence and help players improve rhythmic understanding. The rhythm duets require one or both players to clap instead of play, isolating rhythm as a fundamental skill without the distraction of pitches, style, or any other musical consideration.")

Sight readers who are not comfortable playing in a particular key must devote too much attention to interpreting the notes, thereby neglecting the details. Unfamiliarity with the key is rather like travelling to a foreign country without speaking the language—you can probably get by, but your ability to communicate effectively will be limited because you will be required to constantly consult a translation guide. Likewise, musicians who are not functionally literate in every key are limited in their ability to communicate musically. It’s no wonder sight reading is a chore if one does not speak the musical language.")
                    Paragraph("Considering this, to improve sight reading, improve your mastery of scales and patterns in all keys. There are numerous excellent tutorials for learning scales and patterns, and readers who need help in this area are encouraged to practice them diligently to improve.")

In some cases they have been conditioned to assume they are always wrong; students with this attitude will never be good sight readers.")
                    Paragraph("To improve sight reading, learn to evaluate your success by sight reading easy music with obvious, predictable harmonies and rhythms. Sight reading easy music should help students cultivate genuine confidence in their sight reading so they can stop second guessing whether or not they are right—habitual questioning of one’s accuracy can seriously inhibit progress.")
                    Paragraph("This book is arranged progressively so those who need easier challenges can build confidence slowly without being overwhelmed. The first 30 duets are melodically, rhythmically, and tonally predictable for this very reason; it should be obvious when something is not right. Once students begin to gain confidence, they can proceed to the harder duets, in which it is more challenging to perceive mistakes.")
                    Paragraph("Certainly, sight reading these duets with a teacher is advisable for those who are having trouble. The teacher can point out mistakes to the student and discuss strategies for improvement. These duets are written so both parts are of similar importance and difficulty; therefore, it is not necessary for the teacher to always play either the bottom or top part.")

This analysis can include form, key relationships, style changes, identifying sequential melodic patterns, recognizing scales, modes and patterns of all kinds, and much more. The degree to which you are capable of analyzing depends, in part, on your knowledge of music theory. Those without music theory experience will only be able to notice very rudimentary attributes, but the goal is to recruit all your ability in this area in order to position yourself for success.")
