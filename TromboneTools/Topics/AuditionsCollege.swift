In addition, you should also be prepared to play all your major scales and at least some minor scales (all would be better!). Some professors might also ask you to sight read something. If you know any orchestral excerpts, it is an advantage to have some of those ready to play if asked.")

We might play a duet or two to get to know each other and I might make a few suggestions to help the auditionee improve their playing. When I do this, I am checking the person’s willingness to accept suggestions and integrate them into their playing.")
